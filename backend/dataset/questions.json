You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from Allah and [His] pleasure. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers - so that Allah may enrage by them the disbelievers. Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward.\"\nThis verse highlights the role of Prophet Muhammad as the Messenger of Allah and describes the qualities of his companions who followed his teachings. It also emphasizes the significance of prayer and the fulfillment of earlier prophecies regarding his coming.

The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a messenger of Allah and His word which He directed to Mary and a soul [created at a command] from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, 'Three'; desist - it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs.\"\nThis verse reiterates that Jesus (Peace Be Upon Him) is a messenger of God and emphasizes the oneness of God.
