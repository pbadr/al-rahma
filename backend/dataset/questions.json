They are spiritual beings created by Allah to carry out His commands, and they do not have the same gender characteristics as humans. Angels are often referred to in the Quran using masculine names or pronouns in Arabic, but this is a matter of linguistic convention rather than an indication of their gender. One verse that mentions angels not being females is from Surah Az-Zukhruf:\nSurah Az-Zukhruf <a href=\"https://quran.com/43/19\">(43:19)</a>\n\"وَجَعَلُوا الْمَلَائِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـٰنِ إِنَـٰثًۭا ۚ شَهِدُوا۟ خَلۡقَهُمۡ ۗ سَتُكۡتَبُ شَهَـٰدَتُهُمۡ وَيُسۡـَٔلُونَ\"\nTranslation: \"And they have made the angels, who are servants of the Most Merciful, females. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be recorded, and they will be questioned.\"\nThis verse highlights that some people have attributed gender to the angels, considering them as females, which is not accurate. The Quran clarifies that the angels are servants of the Most Merciful and do not have a gender.
